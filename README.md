# K-Means-Clustering
From the ‘IRIS’ dataset we predict the optimum number of clusters and present it visually.
We use Python language and import scikit,pandas,numpy and matplotlib module to implement the model. So at first, we find the optimum number of clusters followed by the value of K for which the clustering occurs.
